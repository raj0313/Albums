# Albums Prototype
This is a sample readme file for the tasks

There are these following tasks this code has been used to achieve 

*Shows a list of album titles returned by endpoint /albums

*When an album is clicked a photo is displayed

*When a thumbnail is clicked, the full sized photo should be displayed.


# ASSUMPTION
*   To use two endpoints and return information on a single screen

*   Must include navigation to navigate to different screens 

*   Use some sort of state management to manage the states

*   Write understandable and clean code    

*   Don't overuse state management or use it if or when required

#   Decisions

*  I opted to go for simplified design and wanted to complete all the tasks 

*   I have used bits and pieces of hooks(useReducer) to dispatch actions and set payloads. For this particular prototype I did not want to use any sort of middleware as it was just a prototype has it been a full scalable application would have used something like middleware and libraries for UI.

* Thumbails and logic around them have been resolved by advanced features like merging,filter etc
